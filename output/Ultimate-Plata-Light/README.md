A GTK, xfwm4, openbox-3, and GNOME-Shell - Light Mode Theme - Plata is a new Gtk+ centered theme based on the latest Material Design refresh.

Ultimate-Plata-Light mixes white-chocolate, indigo, and shades of gray with bits of red, royal-blue, and violet. Ultimate-Plata-Light supports Gtk+ 3x, as well as Gtk+ 2, and a multitude of desktop environments like Gnome Shell (and Flashback), Xfce, Mate, LXDE, and Cinnamon. The original Plata theme designer (who also created Adapta theme) too forwards theming support for Firefox (via FirefoxColor test pilot), Gedit, Plank dock, Telegram, and TweetDeck.

The GTK, xfwm4, openbox-3, and GNOME-Shell theme represents a careful blending of Material Design refresh elements, in tandem with those of minimalist artist Rafa Capoci, icon designer Wojciech Kalinowski, the Papirus team, and full-stack web-developer/themer Pavel Agarkov, with an overlay of the precise Plata theming hues.


Matching Suru Icon and Folders and Matching Material-Flat Icon and Folders are also available here.

All themed icons and folders have been carefully crafted to match the new Ultimate-Plata-Light desktop scheme, but they can surely compliment other desktop themes that sport matching color hues.

Emoji icons are derived from the Twenoji created by Twitter Team - under MIT. Some icons are based on Numix mimetypes icons created by the Numix Team - under GPL3. Devices and places icons and several apps icons are inspired by Papirus icons created by Alexey Varfolomeev - under GPL3. Numberless icons are from Gravit Designer, under GPL3/MIT. A huge thank you to all those contributing to the advancement of the Suru family of icons is extended too.


Manual Installation Is Easy:

For themes: 1) Extract the "tar.xz" file into your "~/.themes/" folder - to install for current user only - or into the "/usr/share/themes/" folder - for the theme to be applied globally. 2) Use the GNOME Tweak Tool or an equivalent app to enable it for your desktop.

If installing manually, make sure to install the dependency: "Murrine theme engine" if you do not already have it; and update your GTK+packages if you have not.

For icons: 1) Extract the "tar.xz" file into your "~/.icons/" folder - to install for current user only - or into the "/usr/share/icons/" folder - for the icons and folders to be applied globally. 2) Use the GNOME Tweak Tool or an equivalent app to enable them for your desktop.

For Cursors: 1) Same as with the icons, extract the "tar.xz" files into your "~/.icons/" folder - to install for current user only - or into the "/usr/share/icons/" folder - for the cursors to be applied globally. 2) Use the GNOME Tweak Tool or an equivalent app to enable them for your desktop.

Logging out and then logging back in may be necessary on some operating systems to fully implement themes, icons, and cursors.
