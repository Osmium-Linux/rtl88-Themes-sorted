Great news: ChromeOs-Dark is finally releasing ''Stable' versions; and, likewise, is now available for download on GTK-Linux. Four fabulous Material Design flavors have been going through extensive testing, the past couple of months; and, at last, we can all start enjoying some of them. A half dozen more flavors are still in testing; hence, soon, there will be even more to choose from. ChromeOs-Dark is the new, highly anticipated - GTK, xfwm4, GNOME-Shell, and Cinnamon- Dark Mode Theme grounded on Material Design standards; and aims to bring a warm, colorful, and elegant experience to your desktop.

Choose from the four official-based hues of: ChromeOS-Marsala, ChromeOS-Oceanic, ChromeOS-Slate, and ChromeOS-UltraViolet. All four flavors are available in both 'Dark' and 'Darker' modes.

Over the last couple of years, Google has been moving towards a unified user experience with its Material Design interface. It started with Android, and we’ve seen many Google Apps—like Drive, Docs, and Sheets—get this clean, modern makeover. Chrome (and, by extension, Chrome OS) has seen touches of Material Design here and there, but many of these design remakes have still been in testing.

Notably, Google’s developers have recently been working diligently on creating “Dark Mode” Chrome for Desktop.  They have been implementing bits and pieces for dark themes, for some time; but these latest updates are good indicators that Chrome and Chrome OS will soon be very adept at handling dark mode across the board. There’s still some fine tuning to be done, but overall, it looks great; and lots of users are really excited to see it starting to land in 'Stable' so they can go fully lights out on their Chromebooks. These first four releases, for GTK-Linux, are all tuned up and ready to go.

Material Design makes better use of grid-based layouts, responsive animations and transitions, padding and depth effects, such as, lighting and shadows. In desktop Chrome, Material Design is limited to a more rounded appearance, which currently excludes rounder tabs that first appeared in developer builds of the browser in April 2018. Most importantly, we can start enjoying ChromeOs dark mode, on GTK-Linux. Special thanks to the The Chrome team for their inspiration, expertise and contributions.


Manual Installation Is Easy:

For themes: 1) Extract the "tar.xz" file into your "~/.themes/" folder - to install for current user only - or into the "/usr/share/themes/" folder - for the theme to be applied globally. 2) Use the GNOME Tweak Tool or an equivalent app to enable it for your desktop.
