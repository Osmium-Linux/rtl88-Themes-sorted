Arc-BLACK is a flat, dark-mode theme with transparent elements, for  GTK, xfwm4, openbox-3, GNOME-Shell, and Cinnamon desktop environments. Arc-BLACK also has matching Icons and Folders.

Arc theme is 2019's most popular theme, as it has been for the past couple of years, according to major sources: (August 2, 2019) https://www.ubuntupit.com/top-15-best-gnome-shell-themes-gnome-desktop/. As such, the well-embraced standard Arc theme has always been available in the three variants of Arc, Arc-Dark, and Arc-Darker; but, at last, a measurably even darker black Arc has arrived on the GTK+ scene. Even at it dimmest, the earlier Arc variants have never quite satisfied those who need the lights turned down real low, but this black variant should fix all of that. 

The black Arc desktop theme darkens only six elements, on the whole, but where it happens makes all the difference. Significantly, keeping the official Arc hues, contrasts, and structure wholly intact was foremost in this project's objective. Thus, nothing is altered one tiny bit in those crucial areas - as the existent, intact, Arc hues are pragmatically darkened. 

Moreover, the signature Arc-Blue hue is not darkened or altered in any way via the new Arc-BLACK variant. The goal was invariably to keep Arc as we know it, while merely darkening the elements necessary to align with the brightness values more associated with what heavy users demand from dark themes. We hope we achieved that for you.

Manual Installation Is Easy:

1) Extract the "tar.xz" file into your "~/.themes/" folder - to install for current user only - or into the "/usr/share/themes/" folder - for the theme to be applied globally. 2) Use the GNOME Tweak Tool or an equivalent app to enable it for your desktop.

If installing manually, make sure to install the dependency: "Murrine theme engine" if you do not already have it; and update your GTK+packages if you have not.

Logging out and then logging back in may be necessary on some operating systems to fully implement themes.
