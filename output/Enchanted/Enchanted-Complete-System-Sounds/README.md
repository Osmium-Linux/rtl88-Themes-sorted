At last, a new complete sound theme for mass appeal has arrived. Enchanted-Complete-System-Sounds will fill your computer with added life, but only in a way that improves the experience - versus overwhelming it. You will immediately be transformed into a universe where pleasant and reassuring conformations follow you everywhere you travel. 

All sounds have been re-engineered and remixed for quality and uniformity. Optimal System Sounds volume sets at 55%, though these sounds will sound great at high volume, too, for those who wish to really feel the experience. The 2nd screenshot (above) shows the 40 sounds contained in this theme.

Enchanted-Complete-System-Sounds has been well-tested for GTK.

A hardy thanks to the folks at Hamster Republic: "https://rpg.hamsterrepublic.com/ohrrpgce/Free_Sound_Effects" for some great effects, the people at Big Soundbank: "bigsoundbankhttps://bigsoundbank.com/" for the bulk of what you hear here, and the contributors at: "https://notificationsounds.com/sound-effects" who round out the theme with a couple of truly enchanted sounds. Also, a special thank you to clipart.email at: "<a href="https://www.clipart.email/">clipart.email</a>" for the cool pic!
