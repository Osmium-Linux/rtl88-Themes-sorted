Arc theme was 2019's most popular theme, as it has been for the past couple of years, according to major sources: (August 2, 2019) https://www.ubuntupit.com/top-15-best-gnome-shell-themes-gnome-desktop. For this reason, the developers have taken mindful care to keep every element in line with what Arc fans would appreciate. The result, we believe, delivers maximum comfort and readability to users; while simultaneously looking robust and elegant.

Manual Installation Is Easy:

1) Extract the "zip" file into your "~/.themes/" folder - to install for current user only - or into the "/usr/share/themes/" folder - for the theme to be applied globally. 2) Use the GNOME Tweak Tool or an equivalent app to enable it for your desktop.

Logging out and then logging back in may be necessary on some operating systems to fully implement themes.
