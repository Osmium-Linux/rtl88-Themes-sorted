A GTK, xfwm4, openbox-3, GNOME-Shell, and Cinnamon - Dark Mode Theme - Based on the Arc-Dark-Theme and the Official Color Palette Created by Ethan Schoonover.

Arc-Dark-Solarized represents the union of two broadly popular desktop schemes. Consequently, a product which exists to accurately showcase the best aspects of both desktop metaphors requires that theming structure, hues, and color saturation are carefully infused into the mix. Ultimately, a theme which adheres to both Arc standards and characteristics, as well as those put forth by the official Solarized Color Palette, is now available for download. Arc-Dark-Solarized is all about pleasing those who appreciate both schemes but never had the opportunity to experience them as one. Most importantly, the fruits of this combination endure as a real bonus for those who need the scheme because they have to use their computers for hours - but still wish it to look modern and elegant during those long periods.

Solarized-Dark-Mode - as originally created by Ethan Schoonover - is the highly valued color scheme for code editors and terminal emulators. Arc-Dark-Solarized dark-mode-scheme comprehensively adheres to Ethan Schoonover's original color scheme, which has been published for many major applications, with some including the scheme pre-installed. Coders and GUI users, alike, know that - once you try Solarized-Dark-Mode - it is hard to go back to anything else. An Arc-Dark version of the Solarized scheme should prove even more irresistible.

In His Own Words:

"Solarized is a sixteen color palette (eight monotones, eight accent colors) designed for use with terminal and gui applications. It has several unique properties. I designed this colorscheme with both precise CIELAB lightness relationships and a refined set of hues based on fixed color wheel relationships. It has been tested extensively in real world use on color calibrated displays (as well as uncalibrated/intentionally miscalibrated displays) and in a variety of lighting conditions." https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/

The GTK, xfwm4, openbox-3, GNOME-Shell, and Cinnamon theme represents a careful blending of Arc-Dark and Solarized elements, resulting in a flat theme with a subtle color scheme, transparency in select parts, and an overlay of the original standard Solarized theming created by Ethan Schoonover.


Manual Installation Is Easy:

Extract the "tar.xz" file into your "~/.themes/" folder - to install for current user only - or into the "/usr/share/themes/" folder - for the theme to be applied globally. 2) Use the GNOME Tweak Tool or an equivalent app to enable it for your desktop.

If installing manually, make sure to install the dependency: "Murrine theme engine" if you do not already have it; and update your GTK+packages if you have not.

Logging out and then logging back in may be necessary on some operating systems to fully implement themes.
