Arc-ICONS are finally complete and all living in one theme. This is currently the only complete, official-based, Arc icon set available anywhere.

These Arc icons and folders have been carefully crafted to match all traditionally schemed Arc desktop themes, but they can surely compliment other desktop themes that sport matching color hues.

Special thanks to horst3180 at:  https://github.com/horst3180/Arc-theme, for initially advancing Arc, and for inspiration. Further thanks to NicoHood at: https://github.com/NicoHood/arc-theme, for keeping Arc alive and great, more currently. Also, a warm thanks to Sam Hewitt at http://samuelhewitt.com/, for the copious infusions of Moka throughout the app schemes and other areas. 


Manual Installation Is Easy:

For icons: 1) Extract the "tar.xz" file into your "~/.icons/" folder - to install for current user only - or into the "/usr/share/icons/" folder - for the icons and folders to be applied globally. 2) Use the GNOME Tweak Tool or an equivalent app to enable them for your desktop.

Logging out and then logging back in may be necessary on some operating systems to fully implement icons.
