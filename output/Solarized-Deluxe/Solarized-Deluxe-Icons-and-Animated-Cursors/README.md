The Icon Folder and Cursor Set is Based on the Official Color Pallet Created by Ethan Schoonover.

Solarized - as originally created by Ethan Schoonover - is the highly valued color scheme for code editors and terminal emulators. Delivering both dark-mode and light-mode schemes for GTK, xfwm4, openbox-3, and GNOME-Shell this GUI-centric theme - with supporting icons and folders - strictly adheres to Ethan Schoonover's original color scheme, which has been published for many major applications, with some including the scheme pre-installed. Coders and GUI users, alike, know that - once you try Solarized - it is hard to go back to anything else.

In His Own Words:

"Solarized is a sixteen color palette (eight monotones, eight accent colors) designed for use with terminal and gui applications. It has several unique properties. I designed this colorscheme with both precise CIELAB lightness relationships and a refined set of hues based on fixed color wheel relationships. It has been tested extensively in real world use on color calibrated displays (as well as uncalibrated/intentionally miscalibrated displays) and in a variety of lighting conditions." https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/

Solarized-Deluxe Icons, with folders and cursors, represent custom blended color and selections among the Sardi Ghost Flexible, Papirus & ArchDroid schemes with Android Lollipop's material design overlay. Directories furnished are: actions/scalable,animations/scalable,apps/scalable,categories/scalable,devices/scalable,emblems/scalable,mimetypes/scalable,places/scalable,status/scalable,stock/scalable.

Manual installation for Solarized-Deluxe Icons, with folders and cursors is easy:

1) Extract either or both of the "tar.xz" files into your "~/.icons/" folder - to install for current user only - or into the "/usr/share/icons/" folder - for the icons, folders and cursors to be applied globally. 2) Use the GNOME Tweak Tool or an equivalent app to enable it for your desktop.

Logging out and then logging back in may be necessary on some operating systems, to fully implement icons and cursors.
